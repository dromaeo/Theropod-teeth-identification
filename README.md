# Theropod-teeth-classification
Python project (Final for "Advanced programming" course 2023). 

Given measurements for Theropod dinosaur teeth, exploratory data analysis is performed through different methods. A machine learning algorithm is trained to be able to classify taxa in a new dataset at different gerarchic levels.

This project roughly follows the pipeline presented in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spp2.1487 

Input files are 
-'fulldataset' for the training data
-'UK bathonian teeth' the dataset that needs to be classified.
The output contains: PCA, k-means and hierarchical clustering, linear discriminant analysis, random forest classifier
